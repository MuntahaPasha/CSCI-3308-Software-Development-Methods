Our Project, Food4u is a way for users to input recipes, and prices of those recipes to see how much a certain food item costs. It's helpful because say a certain user wants to make a recipe with a certain amount of money, they can simply type in the budget they have, the recipe name, and find other users who have inputted recipes into a data base with prices to find a fit. Once a fit is found the user can copy and paste the link into a search bar and see where they got the recipe from. It's an efficient way to make the foods you love, at the prices you want.
This repo contains all the finished files in the folder labeled as "Final". In order to run the project which is contained in Final you'll have to have a php installed on your device. The other folders contain our CSS code, HTML designs, Unit Testing, and various other parts of the project we drew from in order to create the final version. All you need to run our website is the files located in the "Final" folder. The rest is all our progressive work throughout the semester which we used to create our final php files.
